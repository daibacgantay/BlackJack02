  - It will be played with a single, standard Deck of 52 cards, though you could easily change it to accommodate larger deck sizes.

- Players start with two cards and have an option to hit (draw another card) or stand (end their turn).

- Number cards are valued at their number, Face cards (Jack Queen and King) are valued at 10, and aces are valued at 1 or 11 depending on the situation.

- If the value of the hand with an ace puts it over 21, the ace is valued at 1. If it's doesn't, it's 11. So, for example, a King and an ace would be 21, but one King, a 9, and an Ace would be valued at 20 (10+9+1=20).

- If the Player starts with 21, they automatically get BlackJack and win. If the dealer starts with 21, the player loses automatically, before they even get a chance to hit or stand. If they both get 21 in the end, it's a push (a draw or tie).

- The player may stand (stop drawing) at any time. If they go over 21 they bust and lose. When the player stands, it's the end of their turn, and the dealer begins drawing their third, fourth, fifth card, and so on.

- The dealer will keep drawing cards until they reach a hand valued at 17 or higher.

Example: The dealer draws a 3 and a 7 to start, for a value of 10, then they draw a King. The total value of their hand is now 20, so they stand. If they started with a value of 10, and then drew a 3, they would keep drawing more cards until they get to 17 or higher.

- If neither player nor dealer busts or gets BlackJack, the player with the highest score wins the round.

- If we run out of cards, we shuffle the deck and start over.
